# toy-robot

This was implemented in Java with gradle build.

To run the application, please use the command line tool in your system (I love MacOS), in the command line navigate to the project folder, and type ./run.sh

The shell script run compile the code, running the unit tests, then run the main application by taking these 5 pre-defined test files test, test1 and test2. Please free feel to change or add more test files.
